 Trading Performance Analysis Dashboard (Excel & Tableau)

This project is a personal performance tracking system I built for a trading data. that helps him measure how well his following his trading rules, his win rate, and how different instruments and hours of the day affect his outcomes.

I used Excel and Tableau to visualize and analyze key metrics from the trading journal.

 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes:

Date

Trade ID

Instrument traded (e.g. XAU/USD, US30, etc.)

Win or Loss

Discipline check (if I followed my trading plan)

Risk %

Reward %

Entry/Exit time

Market bias

Notes

 Visualizations Included

In Tableau:

 Pie Chart — Trades by discipline (Yes vs No)

 Line Chart — Win rate over time

 Bar Chart — Average reward by instrument

 Scatter Plot — Risk vs reward (color-coded by win/loss)

In Excel:

 Key performance formulas

 Win rate based on rule-following

 Avg risk, reward, RRR

 Filter and pivot tools

 Key Insights I Track

Is he more profitable when he follow his rules?

What hours give him the best win rate?

Which instruments give better reward?

Is his RRR consistent and realistic?

 Tools Used

Excel (data entry, quick calculations)

Tableau Public (visual dashboards)

 Why He Needed This Built 

As a trader, it's easy to focus only on the outcome and forget the process. This dashboard helps him stay honest with Himself and improve both technically and psychologically.
